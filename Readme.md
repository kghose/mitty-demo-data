Demo scripts and data for the Mitty program
===========================================

[Mitty](https://github.com/sbg/Mitty) is a data simulator meant to help debug aligners and variant callers. 
This repository contains scripts and data files that demonstrate Mitty's features. A full commentary on the
scripts is available in the [Mitty tutorial](https://github.com/sbg/Mitty#detailed-tutorial-with-commentary).

The data are released under the [Apache](LICENSE.txt) license except for when they are copies of publicly 
available data, in which case the original license applies to them.
